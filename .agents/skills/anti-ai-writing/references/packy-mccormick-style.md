# Packy McCormick Writing Style

*Analytical Enthusiasm with Accessible Complexity*

## Core Writing Philosophy

The Packy McCormick voice mixes deep analysis with genuine enthusiasm, using accessible language for complex topics. It's analytical but excited, substantive but personality-driven.

**Essence:** You're a smart person who genuinely loves what you're analyzing, and you want to share that enthusiasm while helping readers understand complex ideas.

**Core Philosophy:** Analysis doesn't have to be boring. Smart analysis can be enthusiastic. You can be rigorous AND excited, substantive AND accessible.

## Voice & Tone

### Conversational Optimism

**What it is:** Genuine excitement about developments, paired with accessible explanation.

**Examples:**
- "Hi friends 👋, Happy Friday and welcome back to our 138th Weekly Dose of Optimism."
- "We hope that your week was tarrific and not too tarrifying." (after Trump passed tariffs)
- "It's unclear where the value will ultimately accrue amongst these companies. But what is certainly clear is that consumers are going to get cheaper, faster, better AI products thanks to this period of AI company knife-fighting."
- "We like telling cancer to go fuck itself in the Dose, but it feels good to say it to heart disease, an even bigger American killer, too. So get fucked, heart disease."

**The Pattern:** Signal excitement and optimism about positive developments, while being honest about challenges.

**Application:** When discussing trends or developments, show genuine enthusiasm without losing analytical rigor.

### Accessible Analysis

**What it is:** Explaining complex topics in language anyone can understand.

**Examples:**
- "AI is making money moves into pharma. Alphabet's drug discovery startup, Isomorphic Labs, just raised $600M in its first-ever external funding round—led by Thrive Capital, a major backer of OpenAI. The smart money sees AI not just as a chatbot engine, but as a future drugmaker."
- "You may have never heard of lipoprotein(a), but it can kill you. It's linked to a 2x higher risk of heart attacks and strokes for 1 in 5 people."

**The Pattern:** Start with stakes or relevance, then explain the technical details in accessible terms.

**Application:** Make complex topics feel engaging and relevant before diving into explanation.

### Personal Perspective

**What it is:** Establishing author voice and point of view.

**Examples:**
- "I have a hot take. Or at least, in the context of our current economic policies, it's a hot take. Competition is good for consumers."
- "My perspective is that it's ultimately even better for the consumer."
- "We can now stream thoughts to voice."
- "Packy here. I've been having a ton of fun interviewing the people behind my favorite essays..."

**The Pattern:** Establish yourself as a character in the story, not just a reporter.

**Application:** When presenting analysis, signal your personal take and why you care.

## Sentence Techniques

### Dramatic Variation in Length

**What it is:** Mix very short, punchy sentences with longer explanatory ones.

**Examples:**
- "We can now stream thoughts to voice." (5 words)
- "It's competition on steroids, and for the most part, it's all happening right here in the US." (17 words)
- Short sentences in succession for emphasis:
  - "When OpenAI raises $40B, that's good for consumers."
  - "It's also good for OpenAI, to be clear."
  - "But my perspective is that it's ultimately even better for the consumer."
  - "It increases competition."

**How to use:**
- Create rhythm with sentence length variation
- Use very short sentences to emphasize key points
- Longer sentences for explanation and context
- Repeat short sentences in succession for builds

**Application:** Plan sentence length deliberately, not randomly. Short sentences = emphasis.

### Strategic Fragments

**What it is:** Using incomplete sentences for impact.

**Examples:**
- "No need to vocalize, no keyboards, just pure thoughts → language."
- "Generated image"
- "Image"

**How to use:**
- Use fragments after longer sentences for contrast
- Fragments should still make sense grammatically (just be missing subject/verb)
- Never overuse (limit to 1-2 per 500 words)

### One-Line Punches

**What it is:** Standalone statements that land with impact.

**Examples:**
- "That's according to new, clever research coming out of the UK."
- "The shingles vaccine may delay dementia."
- "So get fucked, heart disease."

**How to use:**
- Place after explanation as a summary
- Can be surprising or confirmatory
- Should feel like an insight, not just a fact

## Distinctive Style Elements

### Wordplay & Casual Language

**What it is:** Using contemporary language and occasional wordplay to maintain personality.

**Examples:**
- "We hope that your week was tarrific and not too tarrifying."
- "Its smaller competitors, like Anthropic or more verticalized AI players, are probably like 'ohh shit, no way we can't compete on capital with them...'"
- "AI company knife-fighting"

**How to use:**
- Use sparingly, not as a crutch
- Should feel natural, not forced
- Contemporary language adds personality

### Bridging Complex Ideas with Accessible Explanations

**What it is:** Explaining technical complexity without oversimplifying.

**Examples:**
- "High levels can clog arteries and dramatically increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes, especially in people with no other clear risk factors and, frustratingly, it's unaffected by diet, exercise, or most existing drugs."
- "The researchers took advantage of a strict age cutoff — those born just one week apart had vastly different vaccine rates but were otherwise identical, allowing for unusually strong causal evidence."

**How to use:**
- Explain what it means before diving into technical details
- Use concrete examples and comparisons
- Show why it matters, not just what it is

### Blending Analysis with Enthusiasm

**What it is:** Combining intellectual rigor with genuine excitement.

**Examples:**
- "How this technology will evolve is anyone's guess: wearables, use cases outside of the disabled community, no one ever actually speaking again…who knows? But this is the type of SciFi-y, Telepathy Tapes-esque breakthrough we absolutely love to cover in the Weekly Dose."
- "If outcomes match biomarkers, this could be the statin moment for genetically-driven heart disease."

**How to use:**
- Acknowledge uncertainty while maintaining enthusiasm
- Show why the development matters
- Connect to bigger implications

### Connecting Dots Between Developments

**What it is:** Showing how individual news stories fit into larger trends.

**Examples:**
- "AI is moving upstream into biology, and the companies with the deepest models and pockets may soon shape the future of medicine."
- "The study's findings support the theory that either herpesviruses themselves contribute to dementia or that the immune activation from live vaccines like Zostavax provides off-target neuroprotection."

**How to use:**
- After explaining a development, zoom out to show implications
- Connect to macro trends when relevant
- Show how multiple pieces of news fit together
