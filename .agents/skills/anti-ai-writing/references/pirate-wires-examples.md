# Pirate Wires Style - Real Examples from Published Newsletters

*11 Real Examples of Pirate Wires Voice in Action*

---

## Example 1: The AI Study Analysis

**Source:** "Kid Rot" segment and follow-up analysis

### The Text:

"A new MIT study claims LLM users 'consistently underperform' on neural and linguistic tests — and AI doomers are obsessed. A professor on Bluesky declares the 'death knell' of AI, and normies are 'terrified' ChatGPT will rot our brains. Of course, none of them read the 206-page report, which reveals 18 college students had 20min to write essays based on (boring) SAT prompts using only ChatGPT. They could barely recall what they 'wrote,' meaning they just copy/pasted, lol, and their brain activity diminished. I mean, obviously, doing nothing tanks your brain activity (thank you, science). AI is a powerful tool, and with great power comes great responsibility. You can use it skillfully, or you can use it to basically lobotomize yourself — the choice is yours, and 18 'elite' college students cheating their way through a 20-minute psych experiment with taxpayer funding isn't 'terrifying,' it's pathetic."

### Why It Works:

1. **Calling out the obvious** - "Of course, none of them read the 206-page report"
2. **Sarcasm with substance** - "I mean, obviously, doing nothing tanks your brain activity (thank you, science)"
3. **The "you're the problem" frame** - Readers are responsible for how they use tools
4. **Conversational authenticity** - "They just copy/pasted, lol"
5. **Direct judgment** - "it's pathetic" (not "problematic" or hedged)

## Example 2: The Parent Authority Move

**Source:** "Kid Rot" segment

### The Text:

"Two things: unstructured time is the fundamental substrate for creativity. And, uh, have you guys tried just… dealing with this? Take away their devices. Give them chores. Chalk. Challenges. You don't have to pay for your kids to play outside. You can just force them to, for free. Take it from my boomer dad, who used to lock us out of the house in 100-degree heat. When we were thirsty, we drank from the hose, and nobody died lol. O accursed parents of modernity, you've forgotten that you guys are literally adults. Make choices, face consequences. It's gonna be OK."

### Why It Works:

1. **The "Two Things" structure** - Breaks down complex topic into digestible points
2. **Strong point of view** - Directly challenges parenting orthodoxy
3. **The "You're the problem" move** - Parents are complaining but they're in charge
4. **Casual interjections** - "lol," "uh," "have you guys"
5. **Dramatic direct address** - "O accursed parents of modernity"
6. **Concrete solutions** - Not just criticism, but actual suggestions

## Example 3: The Setup and Punch

**Source:** "NYT: Urine Trouble" segment

### The Text:

"Stop the presses: unlike every paternity test he's ever taken, Elon's recent drug test has turned up NEGATIVE, folks (yes, even for ketamine). That's according to a recent tweet from the Tesla boss/Epstein truther showing off his lab results, a direct rebuttal to a New York Times article from last month alleging Elon was abusing multiple drugs while supporting Trump on the campaign trail. In a separate tweet, Elon challenged NYT writers to take drug tests themselves, adding 'those hypocrites are guilty as sin.' Look: I love to see a legacy media clapback as much as the next guy, Mr. Elon sir, but your high-level government days are over — there's no need to prove your sobriety anymore. Pop whatever you need in order to take us to Mars / not tank my portfolio. (And if you still insist on making serious journalists take drug tests… I demand a lawyer)."

### Why It Works:

1. **Setup and punch** - Serious setup, unexpected punch line
2. **Parenthetical commentary** - "(yes, even for ketamine)" adds personality
3. **Clever wordplay in title** - "NYT: Urine Trouble"
4. **Conversational authenticity** - "Look: I love to see..."
5. **Honest about priorities** - "Pop whatever you need... not tank my portfolio"
6. **Rhetorical humor** - The lawyer comment is absurd and funny

## Example 4: The Absurdity Framework

**Source:** "Holy War" segment

### The Text:

"Jenifer Hanki — a… *shudders* cyclist in San Francisco — is suing Waymo, claiming its 'Safe Exit' system failed when a passenger doored her as she pedaled down Seventh Street, injuring her and causing 'emotional distress.' Hanki described the horror: 'The curb-side Waymo's left passenger door suddenly swung open directly in the bike lane… with no room or time to react, I crashed violently into the door' (cue tiny violin). Now, this story isn't just about one stupid lady trying to cash in on her own obliviousness, folks. It's the defining struggle of our time. A spiritual war between the forces of progress and innovation, embodied in the innocent, noble Waymo, and the cancerous menace that is the urban cyclist. The Karens of our thoroughfares. The Great Satan. So let us pray for wisdom in the San Francisco County courthouse. We cannot, under any circumstances, let the terrorists (dorks in Spandex) win."

### Why It Works:

1. **The "This is ridiculous" framework** - Takes something absurd and treats it as epic
2. **Parenthetical asides** - "(cue tiny violin)" shows personality without preaching
3. **Exaggerated claims** - "the defining struggle of our time"
4. **Calling out absurdity** - "trying to cash in on her own obliviousness"
5. **The "you're the problem" move** - Cyclists are the ones being ridiculous
6. **Dramatic language used ironically** - "terrorists (dorks in Spandex)"

## Example 5: The Contrarian Truth

**Source:** "pirAtewIres (now raising at $75 trillion)" segment

### The Text:

"Last week, former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati raised $2 billion in seed funding (!) for her stealth AI startup, Thinking Machines Lab, valuing the six‑month‑old company at around $10 billion with, from best I can tell, no product or business. This on the heels of Mark Zuckerberg offering $100 million signing bonuses for Sam Altman's engineers, and Ilya Sutskever turning down Zuck's acquisition offer that was likely in excess of $32 billion. I think it's safe to say we've reached the 'irrational exuberance' stage of the AI hype cycle — but let's remember these guys are trying to catalyze a utopian singularity, which probably can't be overhyped? Then, just in terms of the salaries, I'm glad America is paying our star nerds more than our star basketball players (finally). Sorry haters, the only problem I see here is my own slow start. Which brings me to my announcement: Pirate Wires is an AI company now, and we're raising. Hmu."

### Why It Works:

1. **Strong point of view** - "I'm glad America is paying..."
2. **Calling out the obvious** - "irrational exuberance" but it's justified
3. **Parenthetical commentary** - "(from best I can tell, no product or business)"
4. **Let's be honest** - "Sorry haters, the only problem I see here is my own slow start"
5. **Self-aware humor** - The sudden announcement about Pirate Wires is funny because it applies the same critique to himself
6. **Conversational** - "Hmu" (hit me up) sounds like a friend

## Example 6: The Institutional Critique

**Source:** "Come and take X" segment

### The Text:

"Last week, a video of Obama giving a fireside chat where he says Twitter will need to be regulated, because it allows 'hateful' and 'polarizing' speech, made the rounds on X. 'We want diversity of opinion, [not] diversity of facts... It will require some government regulatory constraints,' he said. I don't need to tell you where I stand on reinstating the f***ing Ministry of Truth, but I do have one question. Why are institutionalists like Obama SO pathologically fixated on restricting the free flow of information?? They don't even justify it anymore (aside from referencing ambiguous concepts like 'protecting democracy') — it's creepy! Believing it's the government's job to manage our information space is a denial of our agency and, instead, an insistence that only they have agency. Obama, please stop. Go back to recommending music between voiceovers of docuseries about national parks, and keep your hands off my X."

### Why It Works:

1. **Strong point of view** - Direct criticism of power
2. **Rhetorical questions** - "Why are institutionalists..."
3. **Direct address** - Speaking to reader AND to Obama
4. **Calling out the obvious** - Everyone knows government wants to control information
5. **Let's be honest** - The tone is frustrated but sincere
6. **Humor + substance** - The suggestion about national parks is funny but the point is serious

## Example 7: The Failure Analysis

**Source:** "Forgive and forget invest" segment

### The Text:

"Last week, a16z's Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz welcomed Adam Neumann on their podcast to discuss Silicon Valley's long history of epic fails: Thomas Watson Sr. (antitrust), Henry Ford (tunnel vision), and, notoriously, Adam, who lost control of WeWork after a series of questionable decisions culminated in an IPO flop. After all the drama, Marc apparently gave Adam a call and said this too ('the stage when you forget everything you did — and believe everything that was written about you') shall pass. a16z backed Neumann's new real-estate venture in 2022, and doubled down in April, because Silicon Valley doesn't seem to care about mocking Netflix docudramas, or the stench of failure, which makes it distinct among industries. In tech, a swing and a miss is just business as usual. The most successful investors shrug, laugh, and forgive. Then they fund another crazy idea, which, I'm pretty sure, is why they're all so stinkin' rich."

### Why It Works:

1. **Let's be honest** - Tech doesn't care about failure
2. **Casual language** - "stinkin' rich"
3. **Acknowledges obvious truth** - Everyone knows this dynamic exists
4. **Shows author's philosophy** - Failure is just part of the game
5. **Conversational** - "I'm pretty sure"
6. **No moral judgment** - Just observing how the system works

## Example 8: The Political Theater Takedown

**Source:** "Bad Boys" segment

### The Text:

"It's the hottest trend in Democratic politics since Nancy Pelosi donned that African scarf and took a knee a few years back in defense of every criminal's God-given right to riot: from NYC Comptroller / mayoral candidate Brad Lander and California Senator Alex Padilla to Newark's mayor Ras Baraka, politicians are obstructing justice, assaulting officers, and getting their asses performatively 'arrested' while protesting the lawful deportation of illegal immigrants. Then, their charges are dropped, as everyone involved understands this is all just theater, and the politicians are rewarded with nightly news shows, speeches before Congress, and promotions. Which means? Absolutely nothing in terms of our 'fascist' government, which is functioning basically as it always has (though with notably fewer deportations than any prior presidential administration for twenty years). But in this attention economy? It does mean that in the future, every Democratic politician will be 'arrested' (for 15 minutes)."

### Why It Works:

1. **Calling out the obvious** - This is theater and everyone knows it
2. **The "you're the problem" move** - Politicians are performative, not actually opposing anything
3. **Casual interjections** - "Which means? Absolutely nothing"
4. **Parenthetical commentary** - "(for 15 minutes)"
5. **Shows work** - Provides data about actual deportation numbers
6. **Conversational frustration** - Tone matches the ridiculousness of the situation

## Example 9: The Regulatory Critique

**Source:** "The business of business" segment

### The Text:

"Regulators, still obsessed with the radical 'anything good for business is inherently suspicious' philosophy of Lina Khan, are circling Meta's $14.3B stake in Scale AI. With 'Big Tech's' path to M&A essentially paralyzed by growing bi-partisan agreement that America's most important companies should simply wither and die in the face of foreign competition, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple, and now Meta have pivoted to purchasing large, non-controlling investments in would-be acquisitions. But while Meta's strategy is poised to benefit both companies, all of their employees, and the country, regulators remain poor, miserable, and fundamentally hateful. My view: what if the path to M&A was unburdened by what has been (communism), and Americans were simply free to cook again? Who knows, in a world like that we might not even need a trade 'deal' with China that leaves us worse off than we started."

### Why It Works:

1. **Let's be honest** - Regulators are "fundamentally hateful" (direct judgment)
2. **Calling out the obvious** - The paralysis is obvious and intentional
3. **Strong point of view** - Clear political position
4. **Rhetorical questions** - "What if the path to M&A was unburdened..."
5. **Casual language** - "cook again" (street vernacular)
6. **Shows economic understanding** - Understands the actual impact

## Example 10: The Ironic Contrast

**Source:** "Amber is the color of your energy macchiato" segment

### The Text:

"Bay Area electrical engineer Patrick McCabe has created an app called Solve SF that allows city residents to file 311 reports about issues like poop on the sidewalk (#JustSFThings) in as little as 10 seconds, far faster than the city's official 311 app. Unfortunately, because nice things are illegal in San Francisco, the city is about to effectively shut down Solve SF when they discontinue use of the API it runs on, citing maintenance costs to keep the API running (don't worry, there's still budget for needle distribution / grants towards transgender musical theater non-profits). One resident described the prospect of going back to the city's 311 option after using Solve SF as 'going back to instant coffee after having Equator Coffee,' and we'll stick with the same metaphor here. Mayor Lurie, please don't destroy this dude's cracked French press machine. It may be costly, but the government-issued K-Cups taste like… well, street poop."

### Why It Works:

1. **Calling out absurdity** - "because nice things are illegal in San Francisco"
2. **Parenthetical asides** - "(don't worry, there's still budget for...)"
3. **Shows the contrast** - Good thing (app) vs. bad priorities (what government funds)
4. **Casual humor** - The coffee metaphor is funny and specific
5. **Direct address** - "Mayor Lurie, please don't..."
6. **Concrete observation** - Uses real example to show dysfunction

## Example 11: The Social Media Revolution

**Source:** "New X, New World" segment

### The Text:

"Over the last few days, as roving gangs of militant Mexican nationalists and/or deranged baristas LARPing as militant Mexican nationalists attacked police officers, looted, and lit multiple cars and brush on fire in downtown Los Angeles, the press entered its standard defensive position for left-wing violence. Since the mob formed in anger over the concept of our US national border, this was not a 'riot.' This was (once again) a mostly peaceful 'protest.' But we're no longer living in 2020. Now, we can all just see the truth — and discuss it — across our liberated social media, which shapes our entire discourse. Online, some people weakly suggested the average American would disapprove of mass deportation. And I guess it's possible. But will they disapprove of it more than they disapprove of foreign flags on burning US soil, and another violent LA riot? Well, now that we can see, I guess we finally will."

### Why It Works:

1. **Calling out media spin** - The contrast between "riot" and "protest"
2. **Sarcasm with substance** - "mostly peaceful" in quotes means something
3. **Shows author's observation** - Technology has changed what's possible to see
4. **Rhetorical question** - Makes reader think through the tradeoffs
5. **Shows work** - Explains the mechanism (social media allows people to see directly)
6. **Conversational confidence** - "Well, now that we can see, I guess we finally will"
