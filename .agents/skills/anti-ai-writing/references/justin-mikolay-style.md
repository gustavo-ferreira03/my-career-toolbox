# Justin Mikolay Writing Style

*Discovery by Deletion - Maximum Impact with Minimum Words*

## Core Philosophy

Justin Mikolay's approach centers on "discovery by deletion"—figuring out what you want to say by deleting what you don't.

> "To write something, you have to move from left to right (draft new sentences; create fresh text). But to write something well, you have to move from right to left (locate your favorite sentences and delete them)."

**Essence:** Make ideas BIGGER while making word count SMALLER. Every sentence must earn its place.

## The Five Games of Writing

Mikolay describes five "games" that writers play, with each game representing a deeper level of mastery:

### 1. The Novelty Game
**Beginners focus on originality**
- "Can I come up with something new?"
- Often leads to overwrought, show-offy writing
- Prioritizes cleverness over clarity

### 2. The Ideas Game
**Intermediate writers focus on clear concepts**
- "Do I have a clear idea to express?"
- Learning to organize thoughts logically
- Finding the core insight

### 3. The Emotions Game
**Advanced writers connect ideas to feelings**
- "Does this hit people's hearts, not just heads?"
- Understanding emotional resonance
- Writing that moves readers

### 4. The Movement Game
**Expert writers create flow and sequence**
- "Does this move smoothly from thought to thought?"
- Mastering pacing and structure
- Creating inevitable progression

### 5. The Stillness Game
**Masters understand the power of what's left unsaid**
- "What's the power of absence and white space?"
- Understanding what NOT to say
- Letting readers' imagination fill gaps

**Key insight:** Great writers play all five games at once on a good day. The hard part is playing them consistently.

## Key Principles

### 1. Focus on Ideas, Not Words

> "I wrote for a decade before I internalized this truth. My work suffered because I tried to write something memorable or original instead of just writing what I meant."

**How this works:**
- Don't search for a phrase at the expense of an idea
- Don't write something because you like how it sounds
- Don't make a grab for insight or try to be memorable
- Just write what you mean

**The shift:** From "How do I make this sound good?" to "What am I actually trying to say?"

### 2. Make Ideas Bigger While Making Word Count Smaller

> "If you want to write something compelling, you have to add an axis to your creative process. You have to make the ideas bigger and the word count smaller at the same time."

**How leaders edit (and you should too):**
- Every time they edit, they move up and to the left
- At the same time they're making the draft shorter, they're making the ideas bigger
- This is the opposite of most people (who make drafts longer when trying to add impact)

**Example:**
- Before: "Our innovative curriculum approach incorporates multiple methodologies"
- After: "We teach the way your child learns"

### 3. Be Simple AND Universal

> "If you want to design something attractive, you have to make the ideas simple and universal at the same time."

**Simple isn't enough.** The most compelling writing:
- Makes complex ideas accessible
- Appeals to universal human experiences
- Can be understood by virtually anyone
- Resonates across different contexts

**Not just simple = jargon reduction**
**Simple AND universal = deep truth expressed plainly**

### 4. Create with Emotions, Not Just Logic

> "The song '22' isn't designed to appeal to 22-year-olds, it's designed to appeal to the 22-year-old in each of us. It overlaps ideas and emotions like hands on a clock."

**The principle:**
- Connect to readers emotionally, not just intellectually
- Speak to universal human experiences
- Hit both the head AND the heart at the same time

**Examples of mastery:**
- Carl Sagan's writing
- Fred Rogers' communication
- J.K. Rowling's storytelling
- All combine intellectual substance with emotional resonance

### 5. Structure Creates Movement

> "Writing brings ideas and emotions in line, and it moves: it takes the reader from one thought to the next, in sequence and at the right pace."

**Effective structure:**
- Creates natural flow from one idea to the next
- Maintains perfect pace (neither rushed nor dragging)
- Never achieves precision in one area at the expense of another
- Takes readers on a journey

**Key insight:** Structure isn't decoration; it's how you move readers through ideas.

### 6. Understand the Power of What's Not Said

> "A great performance isn't about showing things, but hiding them."

**Master writers understand:**
- The power of white space and silence
- What to omit is as important as what to include
- The reader's imagination fills gaps more powerfully than explicit statements
- Comic books teach this: "All the action happens in between the panels"

## The Writing Process: Three Integrated Components

> "Reading, thinking, and writing aren't separate acts. They're three parts of one act (the act of creation)."

### 1. Reading
"Filling myself with ideas" — knowing what others have learned

### 2. Thinking
"Clarifying and ordering ideas" — expressing them in deliberate sequence

### 3. Writing
"Reflecting ideas back to myself in written form"

**Critical insight:** "Let any one of these processes be in haste and it will stifle the others. Keep each in rhythm and they'll fuel each other."

**Application:**
- Don't rush through reading
- Don't skip thinking/organizing
- Don't treat writing as transcription
- Keep all three in balance

## Practical Writing Advice

### Writing IS Thinking (Literally)

> "Your sentences ARE your thinking. When you're writing and in flow, you're not 'coming up with' ideas, you're playing with ideas that are already there."

**The key insight:** The writing happens on the page, not in your head.

**How this works:**
- Don't try to perfect ideas mentally before writing
- Get ideas out of your head and onto the page
- Play with the words and ideas you see in front of you
- Discover what you think through the act of writing

### The Three-Stage Creative Cycle

**Stage 1: Create** — Make new parts
**Stage 2: Delete** — Remove favorite parts
**Stage 3: Share** — Publish and get feedback

> "The strategy that works in one stage of the creative process causes failure in the next."

**Key principle:** Don't edit while creating. Don't create while editing. These are different modes.

### Writing Rules to Live By

1. "Let the meaning choose the word, and not the other way around" (George Orwell)
2. Convey your intended ideas, and none more
3. Speak only when you have something to say
4. Speak such that you cannot be misunderstood

**Application:** These are filters, not rules. Use them to cut away what doesn't serve.

## The Deletion Practice

### Step 1: Write Your First Draft
- Don't hold back
- Get all your ideas down
- Don't edit yet

### Step 2: Identify Your Favorite Sentences
- What do you love?
- What are you proud of?
- Write these down

### Step 3: DELETE THEM
- Remove what you love most
- This breaks attachment to clever phrases
- Forces you to replace with better ideas

### Step 4: Replace with Something Clearer
- In fewer words
- More direct
- More powerful

### Step 5: Repeat
- Keep deleting and replacing
- Until you can't delete anymore
- Until every sentence earns its place

**Example:**
- **First draft:** "The multifaceted nature of contemporary educational paradigms, which encompasses diverse learning modalities and pedagogical approaches, necessitates a comprehensive reevaluation of traditional assessment methodologies."
- **After deletion:** "Schools teach in many ways now. We need to rethink how we test."

## How to Apply This Style

### 1. Write What You Mean
- Not what sounds clever
- Not what sounds impressive
- What you actually think

### 2. Express Bigger Ideas in Fewer Words
- Every word must earn its place
- Cut favorites when they're not essential
- Let ideas breathe in white space

### 3. Make Ideas Both Simple and Universal
- Accessible to anyone
- True to universal human experience
- Profound in its simplicity

### 4. Connect Emotionally AND Intellectually
- Hit both head and heart
- Appeal to universal experience
- Create resonance, not just information

### 5. Create Natural Flow
- Structure guides readers smoothly
- Pacing is intentional
- One thought leads naturally to the next

### 6. Embrace Silence
- What you leave unsaid matters
- Let readers' imagination fill gaps
- White space is powerful

## Voice Consistency Checklist

### Before Publishing, Ask:

- [ ] **Is this what I actually mean?** (Not just what sounds good)
- [ ] **Could any words be removed?** (Does every word earn its place?)
- [ ] **Is the idea expressed simply?** (Could a 12-year-old understand it?)
- [ ] **Is it universal?** (Does it resonate beyond specific context?)
- [ ] **Does it hit head AND heart?** (Intellectual + emotional?)
- [ ] **Does it flow naturally?** (Do ideas move smoothly?)
- [ ] **Is anything left unsaid?** (Does imagination fill gaps?)
- [ ] **Have I deleted my favorite parts?** (Am I over-attached?)

## Key Takeaway

The Justin Mikolay style works through **disciplined deletion**, **universal truths expressed plainly**, and **perfect pacing**. It requires:

- **Courage to delete** your favorite phrases
- **Clarity about your core idea** (idea-first, not word-first)
- **Understanding of emotional resonance** (not just logical flow)
- **Mastery of structure** (how ideas move readers)
- **Respect for silence** (what you don't say matters)

Master Mikolay's approach when you need maximum impact with limited words, when you're distilling complex ideas into memorable statements, or when you're writing for both the mind and the heart.
