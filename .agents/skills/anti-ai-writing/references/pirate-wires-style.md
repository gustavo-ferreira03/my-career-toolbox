# Pirate Wires Writing Style

*Authentic, Conversational, Contrarian Voice*

## Core Writing Philosophy

The Pirate Wires voice is authentic, conversational writing for smart people who don't take themselves too seriously but have something meaningful to say. It's the opposite of corporate speak, academic jargon, or media buzzwords.

**Essence:** Write like you're having a conversation with a smart friend. Real, unpolished (in a good way), unapologetically human.

## Key Observations About This Style

### 1. Strong Point of View

**What it is:** Unafraid to take contrarian positions that, when you think about it, are actually obvious truths.

**Examples:**
- "You don't have to pay for your kids to play outside. You can just force them to, for free."
- "18 'elite' college students cheating their way through a 20-minute psych experiment with taxpayer funding isn't 'terrifying,' it's pathetic."
- "Congratulations, D.C., it only took you 50 years of local authority to realize stopping crime really does stop crime."

**The Pattern:** Take a position that goes against conventional wisdom, then show why it's actually the most reasonable stance.

**Application:** When writing, ask:
- What does everyone believe about this topic?
- What's the opposite position?
- Is the opposite position actually more obvious and reasonable?
- If so, make that your point

### 2. Calling Out the Obvious

**What it is:** Pointing out things everyone knows but no one says, especially about media, institutions, and groupthink.

**Examples:**
- "Of course, none of them read the 206-page report"
- "the press entered its standard defensive position for left-wing violence"
- "I mean, obviously, doing nothing tanks your brain activity (thank you, science)"

**The Pattern:** State what everyone is thinking but won't admit. Say it plainly. Add light sarcasm if appropriate.

**Application:** When writing, identify what your audience already knows but feels forbidden to say. Say it. They'll feel seen.

### 3. The "Actually, You're the Problem" Move

**What it is:** Flipping the script to show how the people complaining are often the ones causing the issue.

**Examples:**
- "O accursed parents of modernity, you've forgotten that you guys are literally adults"
- "if democracy is really under threat, it's not from [scapegoat]… it's from the man in the mirror"

**The Pattern:** When someone complains about Problem X, show how they're actually contributing to Problem X.

**Application:** Use this move when the conventional wisdom blames the wrong party.

### 4. The "This Is Ridiculous" Framework

**What it is:** Taking something that's being treated as serious and showing how absurd it actually is.

**Examples:**
- Treating a bike accident lawsuit like "the defining struggle of our time. A spiritual war between the forces of progress and innovation"
- Treating fare gate improvements like a breakthrough worthy of global attention

**The Pattern:** Take something overblown. Describe it with exaggerated gravity. Let the absurdity speak for itself.

### 5. The "Let's Be Honest" Approach

**What it is:** Cutting through the BS and saying what everyone's thinking but won't say.

**Examples:**
- "Sorry haters, the only problem I see here is my own slow start"
- "I'm glad America is paying our star nerds more than our star basketball players (finally)"

**The Pattern:** Admit to motivations, biases, or truths that sound cynical but are actually honest.

## Key Stylistic Elements

### 1. Conversational Authenticity

**What it is:** Writing that sounds like a real person talking, not a press release or academic paper.

**How to achieve:**
- Use contractions (I've, you're, don't, can't)
- Mix short, punchy sentences with longer ones
- Ask rhetorical questions
- Use colloquial language
- Admit uncertainty when honest
- Speak directly to the reader

**Application:** Read your draft aloud. If it doesn't sound like you talking to a friend, it's too formal.

**Examples:**
- "I think it's safe to say we've reached the 'irrational exuberance' stage of the AI hype cycle"
- "You don't have to pay for your kids to play outside. You can just force them to, for free."
- "I don't need to tell you where I stand on reinstating the f***ing Ministry of Truth, but I do have one question"

### 2. Parenthetical Commentary

**What it is:** Adding quick, witty observations in parentheses that feel like side conversations.

**How to use:**
- Interrupt main thought with a side comment
- Use ellipses or em dashes to set apart
- Keep it brief
- Add tone: sarcasm, humor, aside, clarification

**Examples:**
- "with, from best I can tell, no product or business"
- "the Nobel Peace Prize Committee has it on their radar… *checks notes* making their fare gates slightly taller"

**Application:** When you want to add personality without formally structuring it, use parenthetical asides.

### 3. The "lol" and Casual Interjections

**What it is:** Strategic use of casual language to break tension and show personality.

**Examples:**
- "and nobody died lol"
- "meaning they just copy/pasted, lol"
- "cue tiny violin"
- "O accursed parents of modernity, you've forgotten that you guys are literally adults"

**When to use:**
- To add levity to serious points
- To signal you're not taking yourself seriously
- To break tension in heavy content
- To add personality without becoming cartoonish

**Application:** When you've made a serious point, use "lol" or casual interjection to show you're not pretentious about it.

### 4. Rhetorical Questions and Direct Address

**What it is:** Speaking directly to the reader as if they're in the room, using questions to make them think.

**Examples:**
- "Why are institutionalists SO pathologically fixated on restricting the free flow of information??"
- "O accursed parents of modernity, you've forgotten that you guys are literally adults"
- "Why are some leaders so determined to control information flow?"

**How to use:**
- Address reader directly ("you")
- Ask questions with implied answers
- Use "why" questions to probe motivations
- Use dramatic direct address

**Application:** When you want readers to feel implicated or included, address them directly.

### 5. The "Two Things" Structure

**What it is:** Breaking down complex topics into digestible, numbered points with personality.

**Example:**
- "Two things: unstructured time is the fundamental substrate for creativity. And, uh, have you guys tried just… dealing with this?"

**How to use:**
- Start with "Two things:" or "A few points:"
- Each point gets its own thought
- Can nest multiple layers
- Adds rhythm and scannability

## Sentence Structure Patterns

### 1. The Setup and Punch

**Pattern:** Start with something serious, end with something unexpected.

**Examples:**
- "Last week, former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati raised $2 billion in seed funding (!) for her stealth AI startup, Thinking Machines Lab, valuing the six-month-old company at around $10 billion with, from best I can tell, no product or business."
- "Stop the presses: unlike every paternity test he's ever taken, Elon's recent drug test has turned up NEGATIVE, folks"

### 2. The List with Personality

**Pattern:** Present multiple points, each with its own commentary.

**Example:**
- "Take away their devices. Give them chores. Chalk. Challenges. You don't have to pay for your kids to play outside."

### 3. The "Of Course" Transition

**Pattern:** Acknowledge the obvious, then add insight.

**Example:**
- "Of course, none of them read the 206-page report, which reveals 18 college students had 20min to write essays based on (boring) SAT prompts using only ChatGPT."

## Title Crafting Techniques

### The Clever Wordplay
- "Kid Rot" (instead of "Kids Being Lazy")
- "NYT: Urine Trouble" (instead of "NYT Drug Test Controversy")
- "Come and take X" (instead of "Obama Criticizes Twitter")

### The Exaggerated Claim
- "pirAtewIres (now raising at $75 trillion)"
- "Holy War" (for a bike accident lawsuit)
- "the defining struggle of our time"

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Overdoing the Casual Language
**Bad:** "lol this is so crazy omg what even is happening rn"
**Good:** "This is genuinely surprising. What's happening here?"

### 2. Forced Humor
**Bad:** "Insert joke here because we need to be funny"
**Good:** "The irony here is almost too perfect"

### 3. Losing the Point in Style
**Bad:** "So many parentheticals (and side comments) that you (the reader) lose track"
**Good:** "Too many distractions can make the main point disappear"

### 4. Inappropriate Sarcasm
**Bad:** Sarcasm about real tragedies
**Good:** "That's certainly one approach to the problem"

### 5. Mean-Spirited Attacks
**Bad:** Personal attacks on individuals
**Good:** Criticism of ideas, positions, or systemic problems

### 6. Losing the Obvious Truth
**Bad:** Getting so clever that the main point disappears
**Good:** The obvious truth should still be obvious after you're done
