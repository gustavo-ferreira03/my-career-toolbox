# Sticky Sentences - Deep Dive

*Creating Memorable Statements Through Literary Techniques*

## Why Sticky Sentences Matter

Sticky sentences are the ones readers remember. They're quotable. They're the lines that stick with people after they've forgotten the rest of the piece. They're also usually the MOST important sentences in your writing—the ones that carry your core idea.

Master these techniques to make your most important statements unforgettable.

## 1. Alliteration

**Definition:** Using words with the same sound (usually first letter) in succession.

### How It Works

The repetition of sounds creates a pleasing rhythm and makes the phrase easier to remember. Your brain likes patterns, so alliteration leverages that preference.

### Examples

- "Specificity is the secret" - @ItsKieranDrew
- "The best jobs are neither decreed nor degreed" - Naval Ravikant
- "Proper preparation prevents poor performance"
- "Fail fast, fix faster"
- "Creative, conversational, clear"

### When to Use

- When you have a key principle to establish
- When emphasizing an important point
- When you want readers to quote you
- When you need rhythm in a short statement

### How to Write It

1. **Start with your core idea** - "Teaching methods need to be both structured and flexible"
2. **Identify key words** - structure, flexible
3. **Find alliterative versions** - "structured, supple support" or "flexible, focused framework"
4. **Test for meaning** - Does it still mean what you intended?
5. **Say it aloud** - Does it have good rhythm?

### Practice Examples

Create alliterative versions of:
- "Learning happens through doing"
- "Students need both rules and freedom"
- "Ideas improve when challenged"

## 2. Symmetry

**Definition:** Creating balance with parallel phrases or structures.

### How It Works

Symmetry creates a sense of completeness and inevitability. When two sides balance perfectly, it feels true. Your brain recognizes the pattern and finds it satisfying.

### Examples

- "Read for awareness. Write for understanding."
- "It's not 10,000 hours. It's 10,000 iterations." - Naval Ravikant
- "In silence, we find our voice. In stillness, we find our strength."
- "Create to discover. Delete to refine."
- "Teachers inspire. Students transpire."

### When to Use

- Comparing or contrasting two ideas
- Establishing opposing principles
- Creating a memorable paradox
- Making a philosophical point

### Structure Template

**[Action A] [Outcome A]. [Action B] [Outcome B].**
OR
**Not [False idea]. [True idea].**
OR
**[Thing 1] [Verb]. [Thing 2] [Verb].**

### How to Write It

1. **Identify your two ideas** - What two things are you comparing?
2. **Find parallel structure** - Can you express them in the same grammatical form?
3. **Test the balance** - Does each side have similar weight?
4. **Check the meaning** - Are you actually saying something true?
5. **Say it aloud** - Does it feel balanced?

### Practice Examples

Create symmetrical versions of:
- "You need to understand both theory and practice"
- "The best leaders are confident but humble"
- "Innovation requires both tradition and rebellion"

---

## 3. Contrast

**Definition:** Juxtaposing opposing ideas to emphasize their difference.

### How It Works

Contrast makes ideas more vivid by putting opposites next to each other. Your brain can't help but notice the difference, which makes both sides more memorable.

### Examples

- "To be everywhere is to be nowhere." - Letters from a Stoic
- "Be clear, not clever. Concise, not complex." - @ItsKieranDrew
- "Simple rules. Complex applications."
- "Confident, not arrogant. Humble, not weak."
- "We teach students what to think. We should teach them how."

### When to Use

- Clarifying misconceptions
- Establishing important distinctions
- Making a philosophy memorable
- Teaching what something is NOT

### Structure Template

**[True statement]. Not [false statement].**
OR
**[Opposite 1], Not [Opposite 2].**
OR
**To [Action 1] is to [Result 1]. To [Action 2] is to [Result 2].**

### How to Write It

1. **State the true idea** - What do you actually believe?
2. **Find the opposite misconception** - What do people wrongly believe?
3. **Juxtapose them** - Put them right next to each other
4. **Keep both balanced** - Both sides should have similar weight
5. **Say it aloud** - Does the contrast pop?

### Practice Examples

Create contrasting versions of:
- "Schools should be rigorous"
- "Students need structure"
- "Feedback should be honest"

## 4. Rhyme

**Definition:** Using similar ending sounds to create harmony and memorability.

### How It Works

Rhyme is immediately recognizable to your brain and creates a song-like quality. This makes phrases incredibly sticky and memorable. People will remember a rhyming phrase much longer than a non-rhyming one.

### Examples

- "Tell a story or lose your glory"
- "Plan to succeed, just plant the seed"
- "Fail to prepare, prepare to fail"
- "Act with intent, know where time went"

### When to Use

- When you want maximum memorability
- In mottos or core principles
- In taglines or key phrases
- When you need something quotable

### Rhyme Types

**Perfect rhyme:** Identical end sounds
- "grow" / "flow"
- "create" / "state"
- "share" / "care"

**Slant rhyme:** Similar but not identical sounds
- "home" / "come"
- "teach" / "reach"
- "plan" / "land"

**Assonance:** Repeating vowel sounds
- "deep sleep"
- "pain and strain"
- "bold, cold, told"

### How to Write It

1. **Identify your core idea** - What's the most important point?
2. **Find a natural rhyming word** - What rhymes with your key concept?
3. **Build the phrase** - Create a complete thought that ends in rhyme
4. **Test for meaning** - Is it true? Does it make sense?
5. **Say it aloud** - Does it flow naturally?

### Practice Examples

Create rhyming versions of:
- "Learning requires practice"
- "Mistakes are part of growth"
- "Questions are more important than answers"

---

## 5. Rhythm

**Definition:** Creating a pleasing cadence through sentence structure and pacing.

### How It Works

Rhythm makes prose sing. It's the musical quality of language. When rhythm is good, readers want to keep reading. When it's bad, they want to stop. Rhythm creates momentum.

### Examples

- "When you can't wait to share it, they can't help but read it"
- "Make your sentences sing"
- "Move from left to right when creating. Move from right to left when refining."
- "Create, delete, then share your work"

### Elements of Rhythm

**Short sentences** - Create urgency and emphasis
"She left. He waited. Nothing changed."

**Long sentences** - Create flow and complexity
"Moving through the morning light, walking slowly, thinking about what comes next, wondering if the choice was right."

**Alternating length** - Creates interesting pattern
"Short. Then a longer sentence that builds momentum. Then short again."

**Parallel structures** - Repeating patterns that build
"Create to discover. Delete to refine. Share to connect."

### How to Write It

1. **Identify the emotional tone** - Urgent? Contemplative? Energetic?
2. **Plan sentence length** - Which sentences should be short? Long?
3. **Create variation** - Mix it up; don't use same length repeatedly
4. **Use parallel structures** - For building momentum
5. **Say it aloud** - Does it have good flow?

### Practice Examples

Try different rhythms for:
- "Learning is important"
- "Students need independence"
- "Teaching is complicated"

- Symmetry: Perfect parallel structure

### Example 2: Contrast + Rhythm
"To be everywhere is to be nowhere."
- Contrast: Opposite destinations
- Rhythm: Balanced through repetition

### Example 3: Alliteration + Rhyme
"Deep in your mind, design your find"
- Alliteration: d-sounds
- Rhyme: mind/find

### Example 4: Symmetry + Rhythm

## The Process for Strengthening Any Sentence

### Step 1: Identify Your Most Important Sentence
What's the core idea? The thing readers must remember?

### Step 2: Try Each Technique
- **Alliteration version:** Can you add repeated sounds?
- **Symmetry version:** Can you create parallel structure?
- **Contrast version:** Can you juxtapose opposites?
- **Rhyme version:** Can you add rhyming sounds?
- **Rhythm version:** Can you improve the cadence?

### Step 3: Evaluate Each Version
- Does it preserve the meaning?
- Is it natural and not forced?
- Is it more memorable than the original?
- Would readers quote it?

### Step 4: Choose the Strongest Version
- Pick the one that feels most true AND most memorable
- Test by saying it aloud
- Ask if it's something you'd actually say

### Step 5: Refine
- Smooth out any awkwardness
- Make sure it flows naturally
- Verify the meaning is crystal clear
