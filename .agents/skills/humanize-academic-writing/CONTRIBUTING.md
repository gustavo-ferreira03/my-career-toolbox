# Contributing to Humanize Academic Writing

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this project! This skill aims to help researchers communicate their ideas more clearly and authentically.

## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors, regardless of:
- Experience level
- Native language
- Academic discipline
- Institution or career stage

### Expected Behavior

- Be respectful and constructive in feedback
- Focus on improving the tool, not criticizing users
- Acknowledge that academic writing conventions vary across fields and cultures
- Maintain academic integrity principles

### Unacceptable Behavior

- Encouraging academic dishonesty
- Discriminating against non-native English speakers
- Dismissing legitimate disciplinary differences in writing style

## How to Contribute

### Areas Where We Need Help

1. **Discipline-Specific Guidance**
   - Economics, geography, communication studies, etc.
   - Field-specific writing examples
   - Conventions for different subfields

2. **Language and Cultural Perspectives**
   - Non-English academic writing patterns
   - Cultural differences in academic discourse
   - Challenges specific to different language backgrounds

3. **Technical Improvements**
   - Enhanced AI detection algorithms
   - Better text analysis metrics
   - Visualization tools
   - Performance optimizations

4. **Documentation**
   - More example transformations
   - Clarifying existing documentation
   - Translations (if expanding beyond English)

### Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/humanize-academic-writing.git
   cd humanize-academic-writing
   ```

2. **Create a branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make your changes**
   - Follow existing documentation structure
   - Include examples where helpful
   - Test scripts if modifying code

4. **Commit with clear messages**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add economics writing patterns to social-science-patterns.md"
   ```

5. **Push and create Pull Request**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Contribution Guidelines

### For Documentation Contributions

#### Adding Examples
- Provide both "Before (AI)" and "After (Human)" versions
- Include a "Rationale" explaining what was fixed
- Use realistic academic text (or create plausible examples)
- Cite real sources when possible

#### Adding Discipline-Specific Guidance
- Identify key concepts and vocabulary for the field
- Note writing style conventions (voice, citation style, structure)
- Provide 2-3 paragraph-length examples
- Cite classic works in the field

### For Code Contributions

#### Python Scripts
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Include docstrings for functions and classes
- Add comments for complex logic
- Ensure code works with Python 3.7+
- Use only standard library (avoid external dependencies unless necessary)

#### Testing
- Test with various text lengths (100 words to 5,000 words)
- Include edge cases (very short sentences, no punctuation, etc.)
- Verify output format is user-friendly

### Style Preferences

#### Documentation
- Use clear, accessible language
- Include concrete examples over abstract explanations
- Format code blocks with proper syntax highlighting
- Use headings to create scannable structure

#### Examples
- Academic but not jargon-heavy
- Realistic scenarios researchers face
- Show genuine improvement, not minor tweaks
- Explain *why* changes improve the text

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** if you've changed functionality
2. **Add your contribution** to the relevant section of README.md
3. **Ensure the PR description** clearly explains:
   - What you're adding/fixing
   - Why it's needed
   - How you've tested it (if code)

4. **Request review** from maintainers
5. **Address feedback** constructively

## Academic Integrity Reminder

All contributions should support **ethical use** of AI in academic writing:

✅ Helping researchers express their own ideas clearly  
✅ Improving writing quality and naturalness  
✅ Teaching better academic writing practices  

❌ Not helping people disguise plagiarism  
❌ Not encouraging fabrication of research  
❌ Not promoting academic dishonesty  

If a contribution could be misused to support academic misconduct, it won't be accepted.

## Recognition

Contributors will be acknowledged in:
- README.md (Contributors section to be added)
- Release notes for significant contributions
- Academic citation if project leads to publication

## Questions?

- Open an issue for clarification
- Start a discussion in GitHub Discussions
- Email maintainers (see README)

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the MIT License.
