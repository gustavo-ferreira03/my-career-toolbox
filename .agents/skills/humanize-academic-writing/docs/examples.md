## Example 1: Introduction Paragraph

### Original (AI-generated)

> Social media has become an important aspect of modern communication. Moreover, it has various effects on society. Additionally, researchers have studied this phenomenon extensively. Furthermore, the findings suggest multiple implications for understanding digital interaction. In addition, these platforms play a crucial role in political discourse. It is important to note that different perspectives exist on this topic.

### Issues Identified
- ❌ Uniform sentence length (9-13 words each)
- ❌ Mechanical transitions (Moreover, Additionally, Furthermore, In addition)
- ❌ Abstract language ("various effects," "multiple implications," "crucial role")
- ❌ Repetitive sentence structure (Subject-Verb pattern)
- ❌ Generic claims without specifics

### Revised (Humanized)

> Social media platforms have fundamentally reshaped how individuals communicate, mobilize, and access information. While scholars extensively document these transformations (boyd 2014; van Dijck 2013), debates persist about their democratic implications—particularly regarding echo chambers and polarization (Sunstein 2017). Do platforms amplify pre-existing divisions, or do they create new forms of fragmentation? Drawing on panel data from three national surveys, this study examines...

### Rationale
**Fixed**: (1) Eliminated all mechanical transitions; (2) Varied sentence rhythm (12, 19, 15, 9 words); (3) Replaced abstractions ("various effects") with specific concepts (echo chambers, polarization); (4) Added concrete citations; (5) Included rhetorical question to show intellectual engagement; (6) Mixed declarative and interrogative sentences; (7) Used dash for elaboration.

## Example 2: Literature Review Section

### Original (AI-generated)

> Previous research has examined social media effects on political engagement. Various studies have found different results. Smith (2020) discusses polarization. Moreover, Jones (2021) explores echo chambers. Additionally, Williams (2019) investigates filter bubbles. Furthermore, the literature suggests multiple factors are important. In terms of methodology, different approaches have been used. It is important to note that gaps exist in current research.

### Issues Identified
- ❌ Generic "research shows" language
- ❌ Mechanical transitions throughout
- ❌ Shallow citation integration ("discusses," "explores")
- ❌ Vague phrases ("multiple factors," "different approaches")
- ❌ No critical engagement with sources
- ❌ Lacks synthesis or intellectual progression

### Revised (Humanized)

> Scholarship on social media's political effects divides into two camps. Optimists argue platforms democratize participation by lowering mobilization costs (Shirky 2008; Castells 2012), enabling movements from Occupy to Arab Spring. Skeptics counter that online activism rarely translates offline (Morozov 2011), creating "slacktivism" that substitutes symbolic gestures for sustained engagement. Recent empirical work complicates both narratives: Tufekci's (2017) ethnographic study reveals how Twitter simultaneously empowered and constrained Egyptian activists, while Margetts et al.'s (2016) behavioral data show online mobilization follows power-law distributions—most campaigns fail, but successful ones scale rapidly.
>
> Yet this literature overlooks class dynamics. Existing studies disproportionately sample educated urban users, leaving rural and working-class experiences unexamined (notable exception: Schradie 2019). This gap matters theoretically...

### Rationale
**Fixed**: (1) Structured literature into competing frameworks (optimists vs. skeptics); (2) Scholars appear as agents with arguments, not generic "discusses"; (3) Specific claims stated (e.g., "lowering mobilization costs," "power-law distributions"); (4) Added critical synthesis ("complicates both narratives"); (5) Identified research gap with theoretical justification; (6) Varied sentence length dramatically (9 to 28 words); (7) Used colon for elaboration; (8) Showed intellectual progression leading to study's contribution.

## Example 3: Methods Section

### Original (AI-generated)

> This study uses qualitative methods. The research involves interviews with participants. Data was collected in several locations. Various themes emerged from the analysis. The findings were analyzed using thematic analysis. It is important to note that ethical considerations were addressed. Additionally, the study ensured participant confidentiality.

### Issues Identified
- ❌ Vague methodology ("qualitative methods")
- ❌ Excessive passive voice
- ❌ Lacks specifics (how many interviews? which locations? what themes?)
- ❌ Generic phrases ("various themes," "ethical considerations")
- ❌ Mechanical "Additionally"

### Revised (Humanized)

> Between January and July 2023, I conducted 42 semi-structured interviews with factory workers in Shenzhen, Dongguan, and Guangzhou—China's Pearl River Delta manufacturing hub. Participants, recruited through snowball sampling via labor NGO networks, ranged from 22 to 54 years old (median: 31), with 60% women reflecting the sector's gender composition. 
>
> Interviews lasted 45-90 minutes, conducted in Mandarin and recorded with consent. I employed Braun and Clarke's (2006) six-phase thematic analysis, coding inductively while remaining attentive to power dynamics in researcher-participant interactions (England 1994). Three dominant themes emerged: economic precarity, familial obligation, and contested notions of dignity. Each reveals tensions between workers' aspirations and structural constraints.
>
> The university IRB approved all procedures. Participants received ¥100 compensation and chose pseudonyms appearing below.

### Rationale
**Fixed**: (1) Specified timeframe, sample size, locations with geographic context; (2) Detailed recruitment method and participant demographics; (3) Mixed active ("I conducted," "I employed") and passive voice strategically; (4) Named specific analytical framework (Braun & Clarke); (5) Showed reflexivity about power dynamics; (6) Named the three themes concretely; (7) Integrated ethical considerations naturally into narrative rather than tacking on; (8) Varied sentence structure dramatically; (9) Used dash for geographic specification.

## Example 4: Findings Section

### Original (AI-generated)

> The data shows several important patterns. Moreover, participants expressed various concerns. Additionally, different themes emerged from the interviews. Furthermore, the findings suggest that multiple factors are relevant. In terms of experiences, participants described diverse situations. It is important to note that these results have significant implications. The analysis reveals that the phenomenon is complex.

### Issues Identified
- ❌ "Data shows" (should be "suggest")
- ❌ All six mechanical transitions
- ❌ Entirely abstract ("various concerns," "different themes," "multiple factors")
- ❌ No actual findings presented
- ❌ Generic conclusion ("phenomenon is complex")
- ❌ Lacks participant voices or concrete examples

### Revised (Humanized)

> Workers articulated a paradox: they needed WeChat to find jobs yet resented its intrusion into off-hours. Li, a 28-year-old migrant from Hunan, explained: "The boss adds you on WeChat. Then he sends work messages at 10 PM. You can't ignore him—he'll remember." This pattern appeared across 34 of 42 interviews, cutting across age and gender.
>
> But responses varied by class position. Line workers passively complied, describing WeChat as "延长的工作" (extended work). Team leaders, however, leveraged platform affordances to assert autonomy—creating separate work and personal accounts, using status updates to signal unavailability. Wang, a 35-year-old team leader, strategically: "I post family photos at 9 PM. Shows I'm off-duty."
>
> These micro-resistance tactics suggest agency within constraint. While scholars emphasize platforms' disciplinary functions (Fuchs 2014), workers actively negotiate boundaries—though success correlates with organizational power.

### Rationale
**Fixed**: (1) Eliminated all abstractions, leading with concrete finding (the paradox); (2) Integrated participant voices with direct quotations; (3) Quantified pattern (34/42); (4) Showed within-group variation (line workers vs. team leaders); (5) Included Chinese term workers actually used; (6) Connected empirical findings to theoretical debate (Fuchs); (7) Offered nuanced conclusion (agency *within* constraint, success varies by power); (8) Varied sentence rhythm dramatically; (9) Used colon for elaboration; (10) Removed all mechanical transitions.

## Example 5: Discussion Section

### Original (AI-generated)

> These findings have important implications. Moreover, they contribute to existing literature. Additionally, the results suggest several theoretical points. Furthermore, this research demonstrates that the topic is significant. In terms of practical implications, various applications are possible. It is important to note that limitations exist. Future research should examine additional aspects.

### Issues Identified
- ❌ Entirely abstract—no actual implications stated
- ❌ All mechanical transitions
- ❌ Vague phrases throughout ("several theoretical points," "various applications")
- ❌ Generic limitations mention without specifics
- ❌ No intellectual synthesis or contribution clarified

### Revised (Humanized)

> These findings challenge platform determinism. Rather than treating technology as imposing uniform effects, we see how organizational context mediates digital tools' meanings and uses. WeChat operates differently for line workers (disciplinary surveillance) versus team leaders (negotiation resource). This variation matters theoretically: scholars debating whether platforms empower or exploit workers (Scholz 2016; Fuchs 2014) overlook how *positional power within existing hierarchies* shapes platform politics.
>
> The implications extend beyond workplace surveillance. If platform effects depend on users' structural positions, then interventions targeting "design" alone—algorithmic transparency, user controls—may prove insufficient. Power operates through, not just on, digital infrastructure.
>
> Three limitations warrant mention. First, this study examines only manufacturing; service sector dynamics may differ. Second, focusing on WeChat excludes workers using alternative platforms (QQ, enterprise software). Finally, interviews capture reported behavior rather than observed practices—future research should employ workplace ethnography to triangulate findings.

### Rationale
**Fixed**: (1) Led with clear theoretical contribution ("challenge platform determinism"); (2) Specified how findings advance debates (named scholars, described oversight in literature); (3) Articulated practical implications concretely (design interventions insufficient); (4) Provided specific, substantive limitations with reasoning; (5) Suggested concrete future direction (workplace ethnography); (6) Removed all mechanical transitions; (7) Used dashes and italics for emphasis; (8) Varied sentence structure; (9) Showed genuine intellectual synthesis connecting empirical findings to theoretical implications.

## Example 6: Conclusion

### Original (AI-generated)

> In conclusion, this study has examined social media and workplace dynamics. The research has made several contributions. Moreover, it has addressed important gaps. Additionally, the findings provide valuable insights. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the significance of the topic. Future research should continue to explore these issues. It is important to note that more investigation is needed.

### Issues Identified
- ❌ Formulaic "In conclusion" opening
- ❌ Mechanical transitions
- ❌ Entirely generic ("several contributions," "valuable insights")
- ❌ Adds no new synthesis or provocative closing thought
- ❌ Weak, generic future research call

### Revised (Humanized)

> Platform capitalism's contradictions play out in the everyday: workers adopt the very tools that intensify exploitation, yet their adoption is neither passive acceptance nor pure resistance. Instead, we see ongoing negotiation—shaped by organizational hierarchies, constrained by labor market precarity, enabled by technological affordances. 
>
> This study advances scholarship in two ways. Empirically, it documents how class position within workplaces mediates platform experiences, complicating both celebratory and dystopian accounts. Theoretically, it suggests we cannot understand digital labor without attending to *intersections* of technological infrastructure and preexisting power structures.
>
> The stakes are high. As platforms penetrate workplaces globally, understanding who benefits—and how subordinated groups carve out autonomy—becomes essential for imagining alternative futures. Technology is never just technology. It is power, reshaped.

### Rationale
**Fixed**: (1) Eliminated "In conclusion" cliché; (2) Opened with provocative synthesis ("contradictions play out in the everyday"); (3) Clearly stated two contributions (empirical + theoretical); (4) Used *italics* for emphasis on key concept (intersections); (5) Ended with stakes/significance rather than generic "more research needed"; (6) Included sentence fragment for rhetorical emphasis ("It is power, reshaped"); (7) Removed all mechanical transitions; (8) Demonstrated genuine intellectual closure while opening to broader implications.

## Example 7: Abstract

### Original (AI-generated)

> This study examines social media use in workplace contexts. The research employs qualitative methods to investigate various aspects of digital communication. The findings reveal several important patterns. Moreover, the results contribute to existing literature. Additionally, practical implications are discussed. This research demonstrates that the topic is significant for understanding modern work environments.

### Issues Identified
- ❌ Vague throughout ("various aspects," "several patterns")
- ❌ Mechanical transitions in abstract (inappropriate)
- ❌ No specific findings or contribution stated
- ❌ Lacks key details (where? who? what exactly?)
- ❌ Generic significance claim

### Revised (Humanized)

> How do workplace surveillance technologies shape labor relations in China's manufacturing sector? Drawing on 42 interviews with factory workers in the Pearl River Delta, this study examines WeChat's dual role as job-search tool and managerial surveillance mechanism. Findings reveal a paradox: workers depend on platforms for employment yet resent their intrusion into personal time. Responses vary by organizational position—line workers passively comply while team leaders actively negotiate boundaries. These patterns challenge platform determinism, showing how existing power hierarchies mediate digital tools' meanings and effects. The findings suggest interventions targeting platform design alone cannot address surveillance absent structural workplace reform.

### Rationale
**Fixed**: (1) Opened with research question; (2) Specified method, sample, location; (3) Named the platform and its dual role; (4) Stated the paradox (key finding); (5) Described variation pattern; (6) Articulated theoretical contribution; (7) Indicated policy implication; (8) All in 8 sentences with varied rhythm; (9) No mechanical transitions; (10) Every sentence conveys substantive information.

## Example 8: Paragraph with Heavy Citations

### Original (AI-generated)

> According to previous research, social media affects political behavior (Smith 2020). Studies have shown various effects (Jones 2021; Williams 2019). Moreover, scholars have noted important patterns (Brown 2022). Additionally, research demonstrates significant findings (Davis 2023). The literature suggests that multiple factors are involved (Miller 2021).

### Issues Identified
- ❌ Generic "According to research" framing
- ❌ Citations as decoration rather than substance
- ❌ No actual claims from cited works
- ❌ Mechanical transitions
- ❌ Vague throughout ("various effects," "important patterns")

### Revised (Humanized)

> Experimental studies consistently find that corrective information reduces misperceptions—by 8-15% in most samples (Nyhan & Reifler 2015; Porter & Wood 2019). Yet field effects prove elusive. When Facebook partnered with fact-checkers in 2017, flagged content circulated almost unchanged (Pennycook et al. 2018). Smith's (2020) panel study offers an explanation: corrections work for low-salience issues but backfire for identity-relevant topics, actually *strengthening* misperceptions among partisan respondents. This "backfire effect" remains contested—recent meta-analysis by Wood and Porter (2023) finds it rare—but the broader pattern holds: information alone cannot overcome motivated reasoning.

### Rationale
**Fixed**: (1) Scholars become agents making specific claims; (2) Quantified findings included (8-15%, year 2017); (3) Named specific intervention (Facebook fact-checking partnership); (4) Explained mechanism ("backfire effect" defined); (5) Showed scholarly debate (contested finding, meta-analysis qualification); (6) Synthesized toward broader theoretical point (motivated reasoning); (7) Removed generic transition words; (8) Integrated 7 citations substantively rather than decoratively; (9) Used italics for emphasis; (10) Varied sentence structure.

## Common Patterns Across All Examples

### What Was Removed
- Mechanical transitions (Moreover, Furthermore, Additionally)
- Abstract scaffolding ("various aspects," "multiple factors")
- Generic attribution ("research shows," "studies have found")
- Formulaic phrases ("It is important to note")
- Uniform sentence rhythm

### What Was Added
- Specific concepts, theories, names
- Quantitative details where relevant
- Participant voices (in qualitative sections)
- Critical engagement with sources
- Varied sentence structures
- Scholarly hedging and nuance
- Concrete examples and contexts
- Genuine intellectual synthesis

### Consistent Strategies
1. **Specificity**: Replace every abstraction with concrete details
2. **Agency**: Scholars/participants as active agents, not passive "research"
3. **Synthesis**: Show connections between ideas, not just lists
4. **Voice**: Include appropriate hedging and critical engagement
5. **Rhythm**: Deliberately vary sentence length and structure
6. **Flow**: Let content create connections, minimize mechanical transitions

## Discipline-Specific Examples

### Sociology Example

**AI**: "Social class plays an important role in educational outcomes. Moreover, various factors mediate this relationship."

**Human**: "Bourdieu's (1984) concept of cultural capital explains how middle-class families transmit educational advantages: not through income alone, but via embodied competencies, linguistic styles, and institutional know-how that schools reward. Lareau's (2003) ethnography specifies the mechanism—'concerted cultivation' parenting practices that align with teachers' expectations."

### Anthropology Example

**AI**: "The ritual has various meanings for participants. Additionally, it serves multiple functions in the community."

**Human**: "The funeral ritual does not simply mourn the dead—it reconstitutes social order. When a Toraja elder dies, the village assembles for ceremonies lasting weeks, slaughtering dozens of buffalo in displays that affirm kinship networks and redistribute wealth (Volkman 1985). Participation is obligatory; absence signals social death."

### Political Science Example

**AI**: "Institutions affect policy outcomes. Moreover, different types of institutions have various effects."

**Human**: "Electoral systems shape party fragmentation: proportional representation (PR) enables minor parties while first-past-the-post (FPTP) favors two-party systems (Duverger 1954). Recent panel data across 63 democracies confirms this pattern: PR countries average 4.2 parliamentary parties versus 2.7 in FPTP systems (Golder 2005)."

## Self-Check Questions

After rewriting, ask:

1. **Specificity**: Did I replace every "various/multiple/different" with concrete details?
2. **Rhythm**: Do my sentences vary significantly in length?
3. **Transitions**: Did I eliminate mechanical "Moreover/Furthermore"?
4. **Voice**: Did I include appropriate hedging and scholarly nuance?
5. **Citations**: Are scholars/studies integrated substantively, not just listed?
6. **Examples**: Did I ground abstract claims in concrete instances?
7. **Synthesis**: Do ideas connect through content logic, not just formal connectors?
8. **Authenticity**: Does it sound like a thoughtful human scholar thinking aloud?

If you answer "no" to any question, revise further.
