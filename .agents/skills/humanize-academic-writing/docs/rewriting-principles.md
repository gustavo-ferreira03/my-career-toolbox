# Rewriting Principles for Humanizing Academic Text

This document provides detailed strategies for transforming AI-generated academic text into natural, human-like scholarly writing.

## 1. Sentence Rhythm Variation

### The Problem
AI tends to generate sentences of uniform length, creating a monotonous rhythm that feels mechanical.

### Detection
- All sentences between 15-20 words
- Low standard deviation in sentence length
- Lack of natural flow and pacing

### The Fix
Mix sentence lengths strategically:
- **Short sentences (5-10 words)**: Emphasize key points, create impact
- **Medium sentences (12-20 words)**: Standard academic discourse
- **Long sentences (25-35 words)**: Complex ideas, multiple clauses

### Examples

**AI Pattern (uniform ~18 words each):**
> This study examines the impact of social media on political engagement. The research focuses specifically on young adults in urban areas. The analysis considers multiple factors including education and income. The findings suggest several important implications for democratic participation.

**Human Pattern (varied: 8, 24, 11 words):**
> This study examines social media's political effects among urban youth. Drawing on survey data from three cities, we find that platform usage correlates with civic engagement primarily among college-educated respondents, though effects vary by income. The implications are significant.

**Rationale**: Mixed short (8), long (24), and medium (11) sentences; eliminated repetitive "The [noun] [verb]" openings; combined related ideas into complex sentence structure.

## 2. Eliminate Mechanical Transitions

### The Problem
AI overuses formal transition words at sentence beginnings, creating a checklist-like feel.

### Common AI Offenders
- Moreover,
- Furthermore,
- Additionally,
- In addition,
- It is important to note that
- It should be noted that
- Significantly,

### The Fix
Use diverse transition strategies:

#### Strategy A: Implicit Connection (No Connector Needed)
Let logical flow speak for itself.

**AI**: "Social media affects political views. Moreover, it influences voting behavior."
**Human**: "Social media affects political views and shapes voting behavior."

#### Strategy B: Content-Driven Transitions
Use substantive phrases that advance the argument.

**AI**: "Moreover, previous research has limitations."
**Human**: "These studies, however, overlook rural contexts."

#### Strategy C: Demonstrative + Noun
Reference specific content from prior sentence.

**AI**: "Furthermore, data shows correlation."
**Human**: "This pattern echoes findings from earlier surveys."

#### Strategy D: Varied Conjunctions (Used Sparingly)
- Yet / Still / However (adversative)
- Thus / Hence (causal, less formal than "Therefore")
- Indeed / In fact (emphatic)

### Examples

**AI Pattern:**
> Social media platforms have changed political communication. Moreover, they have altered how citizens engage with news. Additionally, these platforms affect political polarization. Furthermore, research shows concerning trends. In addition, younger users are particularly affected.

**Human Pattern:**
> Social media platforms have fundamentally reshaped political communication—not just how citizens consume news, but the very structure of public discourse. These changes correlate with rising polarization, though causality remains contested. Youth appear particularly vulnerable.

**Rationale**: Eliminated five mechanical transitions; used dash for elaboration; included scholarly hedging ("correlate" not "cause"); combined ideas for flow.

## 3. Replace Abstract Scaffolding

### The Problem
AI fills space with vague phrases that say little concrete.

### Common Culprits
| Abstract Phrase | What It Really Means | Better Alternative |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| "various aspects" | (nothing specific) | Name actual aspects |
| "multiple factors" | (unspecified) | List specific factors |
| "in terms of" | regarding | Be specific or delete |
| "plays an important role" | matters/affects | State how exactly |
| "it is important to note" | (filler) | Just state the point |
| "different perspectives" | (vague) | Name the perspectives |

### The Fix
Replace abstractions with specificity:
- Name theories, scholars, concepts
- Provide concrete examples
- Quantify when possible
- Reference particular contexts

### Examples

**AI Pattern:**
> In terms of the various aspects of social interaction, it is important to note that multiple factors play crucial roles. Different perspectives suggest that these elements contribute to outcomes in various ways. Research shows that these factors are significant across different contexts.

**Human Pattern:**
> Social interaction depends on trust, reciprocity, and shared norms—factors that vary systematically across individualist versus collectivist cultures (Triandis 1995). Experimental evidence suggests trust matters most in economic exchanges, while shared norms govern political cooperation (Ostrom 2000).

**Rationale**: Replaced "various aspects" with three specific concepts; named theoretical framework and scholars; specified contexts (individualist vs. collectivist); grounded claims in concrete research findings.

## 4. Add Scholarly Voice and Hedging

### The Problem
AI often makes claims too definitively or with generic academic formality lacking nuanced engagement.

### The Fix
Demonstrate genuine scholarly thinking:

#### Appropriate Hedging
Use when warranted:
- "suggests" / "indicates" (not "shows" / "proves")
- "appears to" / "seems to"
- "may" / "might" / "could"
- "potentially" / "possibly"
- "tends to"
- "in many cases" / "often"

**AI**: "The data shows that X causes Y."
**Human**: "The data suggest a correlation between X and Y, though the causal mechanism remains unclear."

#### Critical Engagement
Show intellectual grappling:
- Acknowledge limitations
- Note competing explanations
- Reference ongoing debates
- Indicate what remains uncertain

**AI**: "Research demonstrates the effectiveness of the intervention."
**Human**: "While experimental studies report positive effects (Smith 2020; Jones 2021), critics question external validity given the controlled settings (Williams 2022). Field trials remain scarce."

#### Disciplinary Positioning
Ground work in scholarly traditions:

**AI**: "This study uses qualitative methods to examine the phenomenon."
**Human**: "Following interpretivist tradition, this ethnographic study examines how actors construct meaning within institutional constraints."

### Examples

**AI Pattern:**
> The research clearly demonstrates that social media causes political polarization. The data shows strong effects across all demographics. These findings prove the hypothesis is correct. The results indicate that intervention is necessary.

**Human Pattern:**
> The research suggests social media may contribute to polarization, particularly among politically engaged users (Boxell et al. 2017), though effect sizes remain modest and causality uncertain. Recent panel studies complicate this picture, finding minimal effects on attitude extremity (Guess et al. 2023). The mechanism—if one exists—likely involves selective exposure rather than direct persuasion.

**Rationale**: Added hedging ("may contribute," "likely involves"); cited specific studies; acknowledged contradictory evidence; specified conditional ("particularly among..."); maintained scholarly uncertainty where appropriate.

## 5. Ground Abstractions in Specificity

### The Problem
AI makes generic claims without concrete anchoring.

### The Fix
Always provide:
- Named scholars/theories
- Specific examples
- Concrete data/statistics
- Particular contexts
- Actual studies (not "research shows")

### Examples

**AI Pattern:**
> Research has shown that education affects various outcomes. Studies have found multiple effects across different populations. Scholars have noted important variations. Evidence suggests significant relationships exist. These findings have important implications.

**Human Pattern:**
> Each additional year of schooling increases earnings by approximately 8-10% (Card 1999), though returns vary: Goldin and Katz (2008) find diminishing effects in saturated labor markets, while Duflo (2001) documents returns exceeding 15% in rural Indonesia. This heterogeneity suggests institutional context—credential recognition, labor market structure, skill complementarities—mediates educational impacts.

**Rationale**: Replaced "research shows" with named scholars and specific findings; provided quantitative estimates; specified contexts (saturated markets, rural Indonesia); named mediating mechanisms.

## 6. Vary Paragraph Openings

### The Problem
AI often starts paragraphs similarly, creating repetitive patterns.

### Common AI Patterns
- "This study examines..."
- "The research shows..."
- "Another important factor..."
- "In addition, ..."
- Every paragraph starting with "The [noun]..."

### The Fix
Use diverse opening strategies:

#### Strategy A: Lead with Key Finding/Claim
> Contrary to conventional wisdom, social media use correlates *negatively* with polarization in our sample.

#### Strategy B: Start with Context/Background
> Since Facebook's algorithmic shift in 2015, scholars have debated...

#### Strategy C: Open with Example/Illustration
> When Venezuelan activists mobilized via Twitter in 2019, traditional media initially ignored...

#### Strategy D: Begin with Question (Sparingly)
> Why do some movements translate online activism into offline mobilization while others fail?

#### Strategy E: Use Transition Phrase (Occasionally)
> Building on these insights, we now turn to...

### Examples

**AI Pattern (all start with "The [noun] [verb]"):**
> The study examines social media effects. The research focuses on political engagement. The analysis considers three platforms. The findings reveal important patterns. The data shows significant correlations.

**Human Pattern (varied openings):**
> Social media platforms claim to foster democratic participation, yet evidence remains mixed. We examine this tension through panel data tracking 2,400 users across three election cycles. Surprisingly, heavy users show *less* political engagement offline—suggesting substitution rather than mobilization. This pattern echoes findings from earlier studies of slacktivism (Morozov 2011). But mechanism matters.

**Rationale**: Varied openings (claim, method statement, finding, reference, fragment); eliminated repetitive "The [noun]" pattern; used dash for elaboration; included sentence fragment for emphasis ("But mechanism matters").

---

## 7. Natural Citation Integration

### The Problem
AI often cites generically: "Research shows..." or mechanically: "According to Smith (2020)..."

### The Fix
Integrate citations as substantive content:

#### Pattern A: Scholars as Agents
**AI**: "According to research, trust matters."
**Human**: "Putnam (2000) argues trust forms the bedrock of civic engagement."

#### Pattern B: Findings as Core Content
**AI**: "Studies have shown effects (Smith 2020; Jones 2021)."
**Human**: "Experimental manipulations consistently reduce polarization by 15-20% (Smith 2020; Jones 2021), though field effects remain elusive."

#### Pattern C: Engage with Scholar's Argument
**AI**: "Smith (2020) discusses polarization."
**Human**: "Smith's (2020) claim that algorithms drive polarization, while influential, rests on correlational evidence that admits multiple interpretations."

### Examples

**AI Pattern:**
> According to research, social media affects politics (Smith 2020). Studies have shown various effects (Jones 2021). Previous research has examined this topic (Williams 2019). Scholars have noted important patterns (Brown 2022).

**Human Pattern:**
> Smith's (2020) provocative claim—that Facebook's algorithm caused Trump's election—sparked fierce debate. Critics note his correlational evidence cannot rule out selection effects (Jones 2021), while defenders argue the mechanism is theoretically sound (Williams 2022). Recent field experiments offer partial support: algorithmic changes reduce polarization by 10-15% (Brown 2023), though effects dissipate within weeks.

**Rationale**: Scholars appear as active agents; specific claims stated; critical engagement shown; quantitative findings included; competing interpretations presented; temporal dynamics noted.

## 8. Sentence Structure Variation

### The Problem
AI defaults to simple declarative sentences: Subject-Verb-Object.

### The Fix
Use varied syntactic structures:

#### Simple Sentence (S-V-O)
> Trust matters.

#### Compound Sentence (Two Independent Clauses)
> Trust matters for cooperation, but norms govern enforcement.

#### Complex Sentence (Dependent + Independent Clause)
> While trust facilitates cooperation, norms govern enforcement.

#### Compound-Complex
> Trust facilitates cooperation, but when norms are weak, even high-trust societies experience free-riding.

#### Sentence with Interrupting Clause
> Trust—more than any other factor—predicts cooperative outcomes.

#### Sentence Beginning with Modifier
> Despite high trust, cooperation failed when institutions were weak.

#### Inverted Structure
> Not just trust but also reciprocity matters.

### Examples

**AI Pattern (all S-V-O):**
> Social media platforms affect political views. These platforms shape information consumption. Users encounter diverse content. Algorithms filter information. This filtering creates echo chambers.

**Human Pattern (varied structures):**
> Social media platforms shape political views not through direct persuasion but by filtering information flows. When algorithms prioritize engagement—and outrage drives engagement—users encounter increasingly extreme content (Levy 2021). The result: echo chambers that reinforce existing beliefs.

**Rationale**: Used complex sentence with interrupting clause; varied structure; included causal connection; added citation; used colon for elaboration; mixed medium and long sentences.

---

## 9. Active vs. Passive Voice Balance

### The Problem
AI academic writing often overuses passive voice (>50% of sentences).

### The Fix
Strategic voice mixing:

#### Use Active When:
- Emphasizing agent/researcher role
- Describing actions you took
- Making claims more direct and clear

**Passive**: "The data was analyzed using regression."
**Active**: "We analyzed data using regression."

#### Use Passive When:
- Agent is unknown or unimportant
- Maintaining academic distance
- Emphasizing object/result over actor
- Following disciplinary conventions (varies by field)

**Active**: "Researchers conducted the survey."
**Passive**: "The survey was administered online." (agent unimportant)

#### Mix Both
**AI Pattern (all passive):**
> The study was conducted in three cities. Participants were recruited through advertisements. Data were collected via surveys. Analysis was performed using SPSS. Results were interpreted using theory.

**Human Pattern (mixed voice):**
> We conducted the study in Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou, recruiting 1,200 participants through targeted social media advertisements. Surveys were administered online to maximize response rates. Regression analysis reveals three key patterns...

**Rationale**: Active voice for researcher agency ("We conducted," "recruiting"); passive where agent unimportant ("were administered"); active for findings ("reveals").

## 10. Strategic Use of Fragments and Dashes

### The Problem
AI rigidly follows grammatical rules, never using fragments or dashes for emphasis.

### The Fix (Use Sparingly)
Occasional fragments and dashes add natural rhythm:

#### Sentence Fragments (Rare, for Emphasis)
> The data suggest a correlation. A strong one.
> Trust matters. Not just for cooperation, but for societal cohesion itself.

#### Dashes for Elaboration/Interruption
> Trust—more than any measured variable—predicts outcomes.
> The mechanism remains unclear—though several hypotheses exist.

**Warning**: Use sparingly (1-2 times per page). Overuse becomes gimmicky.

### Examples

**AI Pattern (no fragments, no dashes):**
> The finding is significant. It suggests that trust matters. This is important for understanding outcomes. The mechanism requires further study.

**Human Pattern (strategic use):**
> The finding is striking: trust predicts outcomes more powerfully than income, education, or political ideology—combined. Yet the mechanism remains opaque. More on this below.

**Rationale**: Used colon for emphasis; added dash for dramatic comparison; included fragment ("More on this below"); maintained scholarly tone despite informal elements.
