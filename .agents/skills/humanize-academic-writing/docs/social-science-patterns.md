## Overview of Social Science Disciplines

Each social science field has distinct conventions, theoretical traditions, and writing styles. Understanding these helps create authentic scholarly voice.

---

## 1. Sociology

### Key Concepts and Vocabulary
- **Theoretical frameworks**: Functionalism, conflict theory, symbolic interactionism, practice theory, intersectionality
- **Core concepts**: Stratification, inequality, agency/structure, habitus, capital (economic, cultural, social), institutions, norms, socialization
- **Contemporary debates**: Intersectionality, precarity, platform capitalism, algorithmic governance

### Writing Style
- Balance between abstract theory and empirical grounding
- Strong tradition of reflexivity (especially in qualitative work)
- Mixed methods increasingly common
- Engage with classical theorists (Marx, Weber, Durkheim, Bourdieu) and contemporary work

### Example Phrases (Natural to Sociology)

**Good**:
- "Drawing on Bourdieu's field theory..."
- "Social capital mediates..."
- "Intersecting axes of inequality..."
- "Institutions structure but do not determine..."
- "Reproducing class distinctions through..."

**AI-like (avoid)**:
- "Society has various structures..."
- "Social factors play important roles..."
- "Different groups experience things differently..."

### Sample Paragraph (Natural Sociological Writing)

> Working-class respondents navigated labor markets through kinship networks—what Granovetter (1973) termed "strong ties." Yet these dense, homogeneous networks, while providing security, also constrained mobility by circulating information within narrow class boundaries. Middle-class professionals, conversely, leveraged "weak ties" across diverse social fields, accessing non-redundant information and opportunities. This pattern reproduces inequality not through individual deficits but via differential network structures that reflect and reinforce class positions.

**Key features**: Named theorist and concept, specified mechanism, showed reproduction of inequality, balanced empirical observation with theoretical interpretation, used passive voice strategically ("This pattern reproduces...").

---

## 2. Anthropology

### Key Concepts and Vocabulary
- **Core concepts**: Culture, ritual, kinship, liminality, habitus, positionality, thick description, symbolic systems, material culture
- **Theoretical traditions**: Structuralism, interpretivism, practice theory, political economy, feminist anthropology
- **Methods**: Ethnography, participant observation, multi-sited fieldwork

### Writing Style
- **Thick description** (Geertz): Rich, contextual detail
- First-person acceptable and often preferred ("I observed...")
- Reflexivity about researcher position and power
- Balance between particular (ethnographic detail) and general (theoretical insight)
- Literary quality valued—good writing matters

### Example Phrases (Natural to Anthropology)

**Good**:
- "During my 18 months in the village..."
- "Informants described..."
- "The ritual enacted symbolic boundaries between..."
- "Thick description reveals..."
- "Embodied practices reproduced..."

**AI-like (avoid)**:
- "Culture plays an important role..."
- "Different cultures have various customs..."
- "Ethnographic methods were used..."

### Sample Paragraph (Natural Anthropological Writing)

> When I asked Liu why she burned spirit money at her grandmother's grave, she laughed: "You think I believe this?" Yet she returned monthly, meticulously folding golden paper into ingots. The ritual's meaning, I came to understand, lay not in metaphysical belief but in performative kinship—making visible her continued obligations to ancestors, demonstrating filial piety to living relatives who witnessed her devotion. Belief became beside the point. The act itself constituted family.

**Key features**: First-person researcher presence, ethnographic detail (specific actions), participant voice (direct quote), interpretive move from surface to deeper meaning, reflexivity about own assumptions ("I came to understand"), literary style (short emphatic sentences).

---

## 3. Political Science

### Key Concepts and Vocabulary
- **Core concepts**: Power, institutions, legitimacy, governance, state capacity, democracy, authoritarianism, political economy, collective action
- **Subfield variations**: 
  - Comparative politics: Regime types, democratization, political institutions
  - International relations: Anarchy, balance of power, norms, international institutions
  - American politics: Polarization, elections, representation
  - Political theory: Justice, rights, legitimacy

### Writing Style
- **Causal inference** emphasized (especially quantitative work)
- Hypothesis-testing frameworks common
- More likely to use passive voice in methods
- Debate-driven: Position argument against competing explanations
- Operational definitions critical

### Example Phrases (Natural to Political Science)

**Good**:
- "To test this hypothesis, we..."
- "The dependent variable, measured as..."
- "Controlling for confounders..."
- "Causal identification relies on..."
- "This mechanism suggests..."
- "Electoral institutions shape..."

**AI-like (avoid)**:
- "Politics involves various factors..."
- "Governments play important roles..."
- "Democracy has different effects..."

### Sample Paragraph (Natural Political Science Writing)

> We hypothesize that proportional representation (PR) increases minor party success by lowering electoral thresholds. To test this, we analyze 63 democracies from 1990-2020, operationalizing party system fragmentation via effective number of parliamentary parties (ENPP). OLS regressions, controlling for social cleavages and district magnitude, reveal PR systems average 1.8 additional parties (p<0.01) compared to first-past-the-post systems. This effect persists across specifications, suggesting electoral rules causally shape party systems.

**Key features**: Clear hypothesis, operational definitions, specific method (OLS regression), quantitative results with significance levels, causal language tempered with appropriate hedging ("suggest"), controlled for confounders.

## 4. Education

### Key Concepts and Vocabulary
- **Core concepts**: Pedagogy, curriculum, equity, achievement gaps, learning outcomes, accountability, tracking, school effectiveness
- **Theoretical frameworks**: Constructivism, critical pedagogy, cultural capital, reproduction theory
- **Contemporary debates**: Standardized testing, charter schools, teacher quality, digital learning

### Writing Style
- Mixed methods common (surveys + interviews + observations)
- Policy relevance emphasized
- Balances theoretical frameworks with practical implications
- Often addresses non-academic audiences (policymakers, practitioners)

### Example Phrases (Natural to Education Research)

**Good**:
- "Student achievement, measured by..."
- "Pedagogical practices that..."
- "Equitable access requires..."
- "Classroom observations revealed..."
- "Learning outcomes varied by..."

**AI-like (avoid)**:
- "Education has various effects..."
- "Teaching involves multiple factors..."
- "Schools play important roles..."

### Sample Paragraph (Natural Education Writing)

> Teacher expectations shape student outcomes—particularly for marginalized groups. When Rosenthal and Jacobson (1968) randomly told teachers certain students would "bloom," those students indeed showed greater gains, suggesting expectations became self-fulfilling prophecies. Recent replications complicate this picture: stereotype threat effects appear strongest in high-stakes testing contexts (Steele & Aronson 1995), weaker in low-pressure classrooms. This conditionality suggests interventions should target evaluative structures, not just individual teacher beliefs.

**Key features**: Classic study cited concretely, recent evidence that complicates/qualifies, mechanism specified (self-fulfilling prophecy, stereotype threat), practical implication linked to findings, accessible language appropriate for broader education audience.

## 5. Psychology (Social Psychology)

### Key Concepts and Vocabulary
- **Core concepts**: Cognition, behavior, attitudes, interventions, mechanisms, priming, cognitive dissonance, attribution, conformity
- **Methods**: Experiments, surveys, behavioral measures
- **Emphasis**: Mechanisms, replication, effect sizes

### Writing Style
- Operational definitions essential
- Hypothesis → Method → Results → Interpretation structure
- Effect sizes and statistical power emphasized
- Replication crisis awareness (recent work)
- More passive voice acceptable in methods sections

### Example Phrases (Natural to Social Psychology)

**Good**:
- "Participants were randomly assigned to..."
- "The manipulation successfully induced..."
- "Mediation analysis reveals..."
- "Effect size (Cohen's d = 0.42) suggests..."
- "Replicating Smith et al. (2020), we find..."

**AI-like (avoid)**:
- "Psychology studies various behaviors..."
- "Cognition involves multiple processes..."
- "Different factors affect attitudes..."

### Sample Paragraph (Natural Social Psychology Writing)

> We hypothesized that mortality salience increases out-group prejudice (Terror Management Theory; Greenberg et al. 1990). Participants (N=240) were randomly assigned to write about either death (mortality salience) or dental pain (control). They then rated out-group members on warmth and competence scales (Fiske et al. 2002). Mortality salience significantly reduced warmth ratings (β=-0.34, p=.001, d=0.52) but not competence, suggesting threat activates affective rather than cognitive prejudice. However, this effect disappeared among participants high in openness (interaction: β=0.28, p=.02), indicating personality moderates existential threat responses.

**Key features**: Clear hypothesis linked to theory, specific sample size, operational definitions, random assignment, validated scales cited, quantitative results with effect sizes, mechanism specified, moderation analysis included, interpretation connected to theory.

## Non-Native English Speaker Considerations

### Common Challenges and AI Crutches

#### Challenge 1: Article Usage (a/an/the)
AI often helps non-native speakers get articles right, but overuses formal patterns.

**AI-like (overly formal)**:
> "The research examines the phenomenon of the social media."

**Natural**:
> "This research examines social media's effects."

**Tip**: Read articles by scholars in your field; notice when they omit articles (often with abstract concepts: "democracy," "trust," not "the democracy").

#### Challenge 2: Preposition Patterns
AI defaults to formal prepositional phrases that sound stiff.

**AI-like**:
- "in terms of"
- "with regard to"
- "with respect to"
- "in the context of"

**More natural**:
- "regarding" or just state directly
- Often these phrases can be deleted entirely

#### Challenge 3: Sentence Starters
Non-native speakers often rely on AI for sentence variety, but AI uses mechanical transitions.

**AI-like**:
> "Moreover, Furthermore, Additionally, In addition..."

**Natural alternatives** (see Rewriting Principles document for full list):
- Direct connection (no connector)
- "Yet," "Still," "However" (sparingly)
- "This pattern," "These findings," "Such dynamics"
- Content-driven transitions

#### Challenge 4: Vocabulary Formality
AI may suggest overly formal vocabulary that sounds unnatural.

**AI-like (too formal)**:
- "utilize" → use "use"
- "commence" → use "begin"
- "terminate" → use "end"
- "possess" → use "have"

**Natural**: Academic writing is formal but not archaic. Use straightforward verbs.

#### Challenge 5: Hedging and Modality
Non-native speakers often struggle with appropriate hedging. AI sometimes over-hedges or under-hedges.

**Under-hedged (too definitive)**:
> "The data proves that X causes Y."

**Over-hedged (too weak)**:
> "The data might possibly suggest that X could perhaps be related to Y."

**Appropriate hedging**:
> "The data suggest that X may cause Y, though alternative explanations remain."
> "The correlation between X and Y is consistent with a causal relationship."

### Strengths to Preserve

Non-native speakers often bring valuable qualities to academic writing:

1. **Clear logical structure**: Maintain this. Your explicit signposting helps readers.

2. **Formal register**: Academic writing should be formal. Don't over-casualize.

3. **Precise use of technical terms**: If you've learned disciplinary vocabulary carefully, you may use it more precisely than native speakers who use terms loosely.

4. **Fresh perspectives**: Non-English language structures can offer alternative ways to frame ideas. Don't erase linguistic diversity entirely.

### What to Humanize

Focus your humanizing efforts on:

1. **Varying sentence rhythm** (mix short and long)
2. **Eliminating mechanical transitions** (Moreover, Furthermore)
3. **Replacing abstract phrases** ("various aspects") with specifics
4. **Adding concrete examples** and citations
5. **Integrating appropriate hedging** naturally

### Example Transformation: Non-Native Speaker

**AI-generated (helping non-native speaker)**:
> In terms of the various aspects of social media, it is important to note that multiple factors play crucial roles. Moreover, different perspectives exist on this topic. Additionally, research has shown various effects. Furthermore, these findings have significant implications. It should be noted that more investigation is needed.

**Issues**: This is heavily AI-scaffolded—probably helping with grammar/articles but creating mechanical, abstract writing.

**Better revision (preserving non-native speaker's ideas, removing AI scaffolding)**:
> Social media's political effects remain contested. Optimists emphasize democratization (Shirky 2008), while skeptics note slacktivism (Morozov 2011). My survey data from Shanghai (N=800) suggest both occur simultaneously: users engage politically online yet rarely mobilize offline. This paradox requires explanation. I argue institutional context—specifically, China's fragmented authoritarianism—enables some forms of digital activism while foreclosing others.

**What changed**: (1) Eliminated all "in terms of," "it is important to note," "various aspects"; (2) Removed mechanical transitions; (3) Added specific concepts and citations; (4) Included concrete data; (5) Stated argument directly; (6) Preserved formal register appropriate for academic writing; (7) Used first person naturally ("I argue"), which is increasingly acceptable.

## Disciplinary Citation Styles

### Sociology
- Often engages deeply with classical theorists (Marx, Weber, Durkheim) and contemporary theory
- Citations integrated substantively: "Drawing on Bourdieu's (1984) concept of habitus..."
- Theory section often precedes methods

### Anthropology
- Ethnographic classics referenced (Geertz, Evans-Pritchard, Turner)
- Citations often as conversation partners: "As Clifford (1986) notes..."
- Literature review may be woven throughout rather than separate section

### Political Science
- Heavy use of parenthetical citations in quantitative work: (Smith 2020; Jones 2021)
- Hypothesis and prior findings sections cite extensively
- Replication studies explicitly cite what they're replicating

### Education
- Practitioner-relevant work cited alongside academic research
- Policy documents and reports cited (not just peer-reviewed articles)
- Classic studies (Rosenthal & Jacobson, Coleman Report) referenced frequently

### Psychology
- Emphasizes recent work and replications
- Meta-analyses cited for established effects
- Classic studies referenced by effect name: "the Milgram paradigm," "Asch conformity"

## Common Mistakes by Discipline

### Sociology
❌ Ignoring power and inequality (sociology always attends to stratification)
❌ Individual-level explanations without structural context
✅ Show how micro-interactions reflect/reproduce macro structures

### Anthropology
❌ Generalizing across cultures without thick description
❌ Removing the researcher from the account (ethnography is reflexive)
✅ Balance particular detail with broader theoretical insights

### Political Science
❌ Causal language without appropriate research design
❌ Ignoring alternative explanations
✅ Clearly specify causal claims and identification strategy

### Education
❌ Theory without practical implications
❌ Ignoring implementation challenges
✅ Connect findings to actionable recommendations (while noting constraints)

### Psychology
❌ Discussing constructs without operational definitions
❌ Ignoring effect sizes (focusing only on p-values)
✅ Specify how variables are measured and report effect magnitudes

## Interdisciplinary Work

If your work spans disciplines:

1. **Explicitly bridge traditions**: "Drawing on political science theories of institutions and anthropological attention to meaning-making..."

2. **Use vocabulary accessible across fields**: Define technical terms from each discipline.

3. **Address multiple audiences**: Show how work contributes to each field's debates.

4. **Respect disciplinary conventions**: Match citation style, voice, structure to target journal/field.

---

## Red Flags: Signs of AI Scaffolding

Regardless of discipline, these patterns indicate AI generation:

- "Various aspects/factors/perspectives"
- "Moreover, Furthermore, Additionally" pattern
- "In terms of" repeatedly
- "It is important to note that"
- "Plays a crucial/important role"
- All sentences similar length
- No specific citations (just "research shows")
- No concrete examples or data
- Entirely abstract language

## Checklist: Discipline-Appropriate Humanizing

After rewriting, verify:

- [ ] Used field-specific vocabulary naturally
- [ ] Cited scholars/theories central to your discipline
- [ ] Followed disciplinary conventions (voice, structure)
- [ ] Balanced abstract/concrete appropriate to field
- [ ] Engaged with key debates in your area
- [ ] Matched tone to disciplinary norms (reflexive vs. neutral)
- [ ] Included appropriate evidence type (ethnographic detail, statistics, etc.)
- [ ] Showed intellectual contribution to disciplinary conversations

---

Remember: Each discipline has evolved writing conventions for good reasons—they reflect epistemological commitments and audience expectations. Humanizing your writing means not just removing AI patterns but embodying authentic scholarly voice within your tradition.
