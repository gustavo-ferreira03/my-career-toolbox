# Cursor/IDE Agent Rules for My Career Toolbox

This repository is specifically designed to work with AI agents (Cursor, Copilot, Cline).

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULE: Skills Are Mandatory

**BEFORE taking ANY action about the user's career, you MUST:**

1. **READ the relevant skills** in `.agents/skills/`:
   - `tech-resume-optimizer/SKILL.md` - For technical resumes
   - `resume-ats-optimizer/SKILL.md` - For ATS-compliant resumes
   - `linkedin-profile-optimizer/SKILL.md` - For LinkedIn profiles
   - `copywriting/SKILL.md` - For professional writing
   - `writing-skills/SKILL.md` - For tone and voice rules

2. **APPLY 100% of the skills' methodologies** - don't skip anything
3. **FOLLOW the formulas, examples, and metrics** in the skills
4. **If you don't read skills first, the output will be mediocre**

## Quick Workflow

1. Read relevant skills from `.agents/skills/`
2. Check `data/input/` for PDFs/TXTs
3. If PDF exists → run: `npm run build && npm run extract-pdf`
4. Read the appropriate template from `templates/`
5. **Apply all skill methodologies** to the content
6. Generate final file in `data/output/`
7. If LaTeX → compile with: `npm run compile-latex`

## Key Rules

- **Never modify `templates/`** - They are reference only
- **Always output to `data/output/`** - User files only go there
- **Never commit `data/`** - It's in .gitignore for privacy
- **Skills are not optional** - They define quality standards

## Key Files

- `AGENTS.md` - Complete instructions (required reading)
- `QUICKSTART.md` - 3-step guide for users
- `README.md` - Full documentation
- `.agents/skills/` - **Mandatory optimization methodologies**
