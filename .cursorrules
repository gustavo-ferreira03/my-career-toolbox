# Always read instructions from AGENTS.md before operating in this repository
# This repository focuses on parsing profile data and rendering LaTeX/Markdown resumes.

- Priority 1: Do NOT overwrite files in `templates/`
- Priority 2: Use `data/input/` for context gathering
- Priority 3: Save generated user files strictly inside `data/output/`

Read `AGENTS.md` for full documentation on the expected workflow.
