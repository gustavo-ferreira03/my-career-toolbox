# Agent Rules for Career Knowledge Base

## ⛔ NEVER USE GLOB — IT FAILS SILENTLY

**DO NOT use the Glob tool in this project. It frequently returns empty results even when files exist.**

Use `find` or `ls` commands via Bash instead. Example: `find data/input -type f` or `ls profile/`.

This is an agent-first professional knowledge base.
The user drops raw files (PDFs, job descriptions, etc.) and the agent does all the work.

## CRITICAL: Read the Career Assistant Skill First

**BEFORE doing anything**, read `.agents/skills/career-assistant/SKILL.md`.
It defines the complete architecture, workflows, and rules for this project.

## Quick Reference

### Architecture

```
data/input/     → User drops files here (PDFs, job descriptions, links)
profile/        → Knowledge base (agent generates and maintains this)
data/output/    → Generated outputs (resumes, cover letters, etc.)
templates/      → Structural references (never modify)
```

### ⛔ Resumes are LaTeX ONLY

**NEVER generate Markdown resumes.** Always use `templates/output/latex/curriculo_template.tex` as the base. Output `.tex` to `data/output/latex/`, then compile with `npm run compile-latex`.

**Copy the preamble (everything before `\begin{document}`) VERBATIM from the template. Only modify content between `\begin{document}` and `\end{document}`. NEVER strip `\` from LaTeX commands.**

The `tailored-resume-generator` skill shows Markdown examples — **IGNORE its format, use LaTeX.**

### Available Skills (ONLY these exist)

1. **`career-assistant`** — Main skill. Orchestrates everything. READ THIS FIRST.
2. **`tailored-resume-generator`** — Methodology for tailoring resumes (ignore its Markdown format).
3. **`linkedin-profile-optimizer`** — Methodology for LinkedIn profile optimization.
4. **`copywriting`** — Persuasive writing principles (bullets, headlines).
5. **`marketing-psychology`** — Impact framing (social proof, authority, anchoring).
6. **`writing-skills`** — Meta-skill for creating/editing other skills.

Do NOT try to load `tech-resume-optimizer`, `resume-ats-optimizer`, or any skill not listed above.

### Key Rules

- **Never modify `templates/`** — They are structural references only
- **Always output to `data/output/`** — Never overwrite input files
- **Never commit `data/` or `profile/`** — They contain personal information
- **profile/ is the source of truth** — Always read it before generating outputs
- **Skills are mandatory** — Read the relevant skill before generating any output
- **Plain text only in outputs** — NEVER use emojis, unicode arrows, em-dashes, en-dashes, fancy quotes, or decorative unicode in generated outputs. Use only plain ASCII/Latin characters.
- **ALWAYS process `data/input/` first** — Before generating ANY output, check `data/input/` for unprocessed files and extract them into `profile/`. Do NOT skip this even if `profile/` already has data.
- **DO NOT use glob** — It frequently fails. Use `find` or `ls` commands instead when checking for files
