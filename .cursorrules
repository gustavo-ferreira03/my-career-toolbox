# Agent Rules for Career Knowledge Base

This repository is an agent-first professional knowledge base.
The user drops raw files (PDFs, job descriptions, etc.) and the agent does all the work.

## CRITICAL: Read the Career Assistant Skill First

**BEFORE doing anything**, read `.agents/skills/career-assistant/SKILL.md`.
It defines the complete architecture, workflows, and rules for this project.

## Quick Reference

### Architecture

```
data/input/     → User drops files here (PDFs, job descriptions, links)
profile/        → Knowledge base (agent generates and maintains this)
data/output/    → Generated outputs (resumes, cover letters, etc.)
templates/      → Structural references (never modify)
```

### Available Skills

1. **`career-assistant`** — Main skill. Orchestrates everything. READ THIS FIRST.
2. **`tailored-resume-generator`** — Methodology for tailoring resumes to job descriptions.
3. **`linkedin-profile-optimizer`** — Methodology for LinkedIn profile optimization.
4. **`writing-skills`** — Meta-skill for creating/editing other skills.

### Key Rules

- **Never modify `templates/`** — They are structural references only
- **Always output to `data/output/`** — Never overwrite input files
- **Never commit `data/` or `profile/`** — They contain personal information
- **profile/ is the source of truth** — Always read it before generating outputs
- **Skills are mandatory** — Read the relevant skill before generating any output
